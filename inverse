\label{genrannumgen}

Suppose we wish to simulate a random variable X with density $f_{X}$ for
which there is no R function. This can be done via $F_X^{-1}(U)$, where
U has a U(0,1) distribution.  In other words, we call {\bf runif()} and
then plug the result into the inverse of the cdf of X. 

For example, say X has the density 2t on (0,1). Then $F_X(t) = t^2$, so
$F^{-1}(s) = s^{0.5}$.  We can then generate an X as {\bf
sqrt(runif(1))}.  Here's why:

For brevity, denote $F_X^{-1}$ as G.  Our generated random variable is
then Y = G(U).  Then

\begin{eqnarray}
F_Y(t) &=& P[G(U)\leq t] \\
& = & P[U\leq G^{-1}(t)] \\
& = & P[U\leq F_X(t)] \\
& = & F_X(t)
\end{eqnarray}

(this last coming from the fact that U has a uniform distribution on
(0,1)).

In other words, Y and X have the same cdf, i.e.\ the same distribution!
This is exactly what we want.

Note that this method, though valid, is not necessarily practical, since
computing $F_X^{-1}$ may not be easy.
